#githubProxy

This is a nodjs-server which is used as a light github API proxy.
It handles the login procedure trough OAuth and hiding the security tokens require
for API calls.

It will handle caching and other neat stuff in the future

The goal of this project is to learn about nodejs and how a good workflow could be in serverside javascipt.
Maybe some features or techniques will be used just for case of it.
